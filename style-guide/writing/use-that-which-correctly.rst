================================
Use *that* and *which* correctly
================================

A *restrictive* clause is essential to the meaning of a sentence because it
limits the noun to which it refers. If you omit a restrictive clause, you
change the meaning of the sentence. You indicate a restrictive clause with the
relative pronoun *that* or *who*, and you don't set off a restrictive clause
with commas.

A *nonrestrictive* clause doesn't change the core meaning of the sentence. You
set off a nonrestrictive clause with commas and the relative pronoun
*which* or *who*.

       for two days**.

.. _restrictive-clauses:

Be sure to clarify restrictive clauses, as follows:

-  Include the relative pronoun (usually *that*). You can identify
   restrictive clauses in which *that* is missing by looking for two
   successive nouns.
-  Don't substitute *which* for *that*.
