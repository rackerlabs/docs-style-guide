Use effective verbs
===================

Verbs carry the action in a sentence, and they make your content
come alive for users. To make the biggest impact with your writing,
use strong, simple, action verbs. See the following sections for specific
guidelines.

Use action-oriented verbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbs are supposed to carry the action in a sentence. However, when you use
verbs like *be*, *have*, *make*, or *do* (and their variants), or when you use
gerunds (*-ing* words), nouns carry the action and weaken the meaning. Shift
the focus from nouns to verbs by replacing weak verbs and gerunds with strong,
action-oriented verbs. Relying on verbs rather than nouns usually makes
sentences shorter, clearer, and more direct.

Avoid nouns built from verbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many nouns are built from verbs, for example, *description* and *explanation*.
Such nouns are called *nominalizations*. Sentences that include a
nominalization *and* a verb can often be simplified by changing the
nominalization back into a verb and omitting the existing verb (as shown in the
following examples).

   * - The program **encrypts** user IDs and passwords.
     - The program **enables the encryption of** user IDs and passwords.

Use the simplest tense
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple verbs, such as verbs in the present tense, are easier to read and
understand than complex verbs, such as verbs in the progressive or
perfect tense, or verbs combined with helping verbs (such as *can*,
*may*, *might*, *must*, and *should*).

.. _helping-verbs:

Use helping verbs accurately
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to use the following helping verbs, use them accurately and
consistently:

- **Can**: Use *can* to indicate the ability to perform an action.
- **May**: Use *may* to indicate permission.
- **Might**: Use *might* to indicate probability or possibility.
- **Must**: You can use *must* to indicate the necessity of an action. However,
  in general, use the imperative mood, which implies the subject *you* and
  doesn't require *must* but still indicates necessity.
- **Should**: Use *should* to tell users what they *ought* to do. Because
  *should* implies uncertainty, avoid using it unless you explain further.

   * - The worker **must** delete the message when work is done.
   * - To avoid losing a claim in the middle of processing a message, clients
       **should** periodically renew claims during long-running batches of
       work.

Use single-word verbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When possible, use single-word verbs rather than phrasal verbs (verbs
followed by prepositions or adverbs). For example, use *omit* rather
than *leave out*, or shorten *start up* to *start*. One-word verbs are
easier to understand and to translate.

If you must use a phrasal verb, keep the parts of the verb together
unless that changes the meaning of the sentence. Some acceptable phrasal
verbs are *back up*, *log in*, *set up*, *shut down*, and *work around*.

.. note::

   Don't turn a phrasal verb into a single-word verb. For
   example, don't use *login*, *setup*, or *workaround* as verbs. These
   single-word terms should be used only as nouns or adjectives.

Don't use verbs as nouns or adjectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a word is defined in the dictionary as a verb, don't use it as a
noun or adjective. Some verbs that are commonly misused as nouns or
adjectives are *configure*, *compile*, *debug*, and *install*.

       bottom of the output text.
     - When the **compile process** is finished, the following message appears
       at the bottom of the output text.

Don't use nonverbs as verbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't use nouns or adjectives as verbs, and don't add verb suffixes to
abbreviations, nouns, or conjunctions.

     - Some databases and search engines **AND** adjacent words in a keyword
       search.
   * - **Navigate** to the new directory.
     - **CD** to the new directory.

Use transitive verbs transitively, not intransitively
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transitive verbs, such as *display* and *complete*, require a direct
object. Intransitive verbs don't require a direct object. Be sure to
use each type of verb correctly.

To avoid using a transitive verb intransitively, you can make it passive
if the performer of the action is understood or not important.

   * - After the installation **is completed**, ensure that the FTP services
       are running.
     - After the installation **completes**, ensure that the FTP services are

Don't humanize inanimate objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Be careful not to ascribe human feelings, motivations, and actions to
inanimate objects. For example, a software program doesn't know, need,
remember, see, think, understand, or want. However, it can detect,
record, require, store, check, calculate, and process.

The following anthropomorphic verbs are acceptable in the computer
industry: accept, calculate, deny, detect, interact, interpret, listen,
refuse, read, and write.
