Using Rackspace trademarks correctly protects Rackspace brands and
intellectual property, and promotes our reputation. Using third-party
trademarks correctly protects Rackspace from legal action.

Rackspace Legal has created comprehensive guidelines for using
trademarks at Rackspace. To get a comprehensive view of trademarks, read

   * - Show a trademark exactly as it's shown by the owning company (Rackspace
       or third-party). Don't change the capitalization or abbreviate the
       trademark.

       Abbreviations are acceptable only if they're used by the owning company
       and also trademarked.

   * - Use trademarks as adjectives on first use in the text of an article or
       chapter, and as often as possible after that.

       After first use, you can use the trademark as an noun if it's clear
       that you're referring to that trademark.

       Don't use a trademark as a verb.
     - Each cloud server has a single private IP address. When you use the
       RackConnect solution, if you need direct access to the cloud server from

       server.

       trademark. For example, don't attach a trademark to another term by
       using a hyphen or slash.

       sites-enabled layout in the same manner as a Debian-based Apache
       installation.
   * - Always distinguish a third-party trademark from a Rackspace product name
       or trademark. Generally you can do this through ensuring that words
       intervene between the trademarks.

       Show trademarks of different companies together only if a license or
       agreement exists between the two companies. In such cases, use italics
       to distinguish one trademark from the other. You can generally do this
       just on first use of the two terms together in the document or article.

       outside of the trademark. On the first use of this trademark in a
       document, in body content (not in headings ), use bold font and use a
       registered trademark symbol. In RST files, syntax is the
       `**Fanatical Support**\®`. In Markdown (md) files, the syntax is
       `**Fanatical Support**&reg;`.
