Screenshot guidelines and process
=================================

When your content references a user interface (UI), consider whether you
need to include screenshots. Screenshots can be helpful when text alone
cannot adequately convey instructions, and users like screenshots and
find them useful. However, screenshots are difficult and time-consuming
to maintain, and present translation problems. Therefore, you should minimize
the use of screenshots within your content.

When to use screenshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use screenshots for the following purposes:

-  Orient users in a complicated or long procedure

-  Show complex windows or dialog boxes, such as those that contain
   multiple subsets of information, with free-form text fields and many
   options available for selection

-  Emphasize a new feature or change in the UI

However, *do not* create or use screenshots of the following items:

-  Code samples (instead, show code samples in code blocks)

-  Dialog boxes that are easy to understand, such as drop-down lists and
   option buttons with few or no free-form text fields

-  Confirmation boxes

-  License agreement boxes

-  Message text (instead show message text within regular text)

-  Progress bars

-  Welcome windows

-  Wizard pages, especially Welcome pages and other simple pages

-  Tables created in another authoring tool

-  The captured screen is volatile and likely to chage frequently.

Screenshot alternatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an alternative to screenshots, use the correct names of the UI labels
with which the user must interact and the values that they must choose
or enter. Show the names of buttons, options, check boxes, menus,
windows, dialog boxes, and so on as they appear on the UI. For example,
for straightforward instructions like, "To open a file, select **File >
Open**," a screenshot is not required.

Before you create a screenshot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install Jing to capture and edit screenshots. Jing is available as `a
free download <https://www.techsmith.com/jing.html>`__.

To learn how to take a screenshot and make a callout, use the Jing
`capture an
image <https://www.techsmith.com/tutorial-jing-capture-an-image.html>`__
tutorial.

.. note::

   Jing does not support Linux distributions, but you can use
   other programs such as gscreendemp, GreenShot, and Shutter on Linux.

Screenshots in procedures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you include a screenshot in a procedure, place it directly under the
step that it illustrates. Do not rely on the screenshot to show
information or values that the user must enter. Instead, always provide that
information in the text of the steps. However, ensure that the
screenshot accurately reflects the directions and values in the step
text.

Screenshot checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following standards when creating your screenshots:

-  **Size**: Make screenshots no larger than 600 pixels wide.
-  **Scope**: Limit the scope of a screenshot to just the portion of
   the UI that shows the action, plus enough surrounding detail to help
   the user locate the item.
-  **Callouts**: Use only arrows and boxes for callouts. Use **Red**
   (hexadecimal color **FF0000**) for all callout arrows and boxes.
-  **File name**: Create unique and meaningful file names to easily
   differentiate between screenshots.
-  **Titles:** Titles are not required, especially for screenshots
   in procedures and tutorials. If you want to add a title to a
   screenshot for clarity, follow the guidelines in :ref:`titles-and-headings`.
-  **Personal or private details**: Make sure to mask, modify, or remove
   any personal identifiers, passwords, logins, or other information that 
   could compromise security.
-  **\<alt\> property**: Use the \<alt\> property to briefly describe the
   screenshot for visually-impaired readers. The following list provides
   some guidance:

      -  For decorative images: leave alt-text blank.
      -  For images with text: use the text in the image.
      -  For charts and graphs: summarize the trend or take-away point.
      -  For other images: What does the image represent or add to the document?
