User interface writing tips
===========================

When writing content for UIs, use the following list to ensure that you are
writing to your audience:

- Write content that is useful. If a message isn’t relevant, remove it. If it
  isn’t specific and actionable, rewrite it.

- Choose language that is clear and easy to understand. When possible, use
  fewer words. Every word should demonstrate value to the user and reflect
  business and brand goals.

- Avoid non sequiturs, obscure references, or non-standard turns of phrase
  that might confuse or interrupt.

- Write objectively. Do not use humor, jargon, exclamation marks, idioms,
  metaphors, and other colloquialisms.

- Keep content scannable. Use content patterns to support scanning and promote
  familiarity with messaging.

- When possible, use progressive content disclosure to improve clarity and
  reduce cognitive load.

- Help users avoid errors and roadblocks. Make sure content helps users
  recover quickly if those things happen.

- Avoid :ref:`abbreviations<abbreviations>`, acronyms, and slang. Use an
  abbreviation only if it is better known than the word that it stands for or
  if space savings is critical.

- Write in :ref:`active voice<use-active-voice>`.

- Use :ref:`contractions<contractions>` according to the Rackspace style for
  technical content.

- Use inclusive language. Speak directly to users when you know enough about
  them.

- Consider using imagery to signal reassurance and whimsy. Well-chosen
  illustrations can be more universal, less open to negative interpretation,
  and localize more effectively.

Point of view
-------------

Use the second person to address the user. Avoid using the first
person in interface content because it can create confusion
about who is being addressed. When possible, avoid pronouns in interface
content. For more information, see :ref:`Write to the user<write-to-the-user>`.

Provide context
---------------

Providing context for key features and tasks and stating their importance
helps users understand the benefits of a service.

       Rackspace-created terms as a substitute for clearly explaining options.
     - Monitoring keeps your applications up and running. You can use
       monitoring to track and gather information about the applications that
       you run to prevent downtime.
     - Use Rackspace Monitoring to prevent downtime.

User over the program
---------------------

Create content that anticipates user needs, not content that reflects a
Rackspace state or activity.

   * - Description
     - Use

   * - Explain how to use Rackspace features and options, not what a Rackspace
       service is doing.
     - Choose the default search engine to use in the address bar and search
       bar.
     - Choose your default search engine. Rackspace uses it in the location
       bar, search bar, and start page.

Educate
-------

Educate users about features and options without talking down to them or
appearing to judge them.

   * - Alert users if they can’t undo an action. Explain consequences and
       alternatives. Be brief, but thorough. Answer questions users might have.
       Don’t use confrontational language. Don’t try to scare users into
       learning more.
     - When you reset your password, you will lose any data that is not on one
       of your devices. Learn more about the data on your devices.
     - **Are you sure you want to reset your password?** Resetting your
       password will erase your data from your servers.

Be clear
--------

Use easy-to-understand language that aligns content with functionality. Focus
on what happens to the user, not on what is happening to the software. In your
content is it better for it to be correct than for it to be exhaustively
technically accurate. Be :ref:`clear and concise<write-clear-concise-sentences-paragraphs>`.

       understand benefits and outcomes. Don’t explain the wrong thing or be
       overly broad about the consequences of user actions.
     - Change Master Password: A Master Password encrypts other passwords
       you've asked Rackspace to remember. When you create a Master Password,
       Rackspace will ask you to enter it once per session before retrieving
       stored passwords. If you forget your Master Password and need to reset
       it, Rackspace will delete all other stored password information
     - Change Master Password: A Master Password is used to protect sensitive
       information like site passwords. If you create a Master Password you
       will be asked to enter it once per session when Rackspace retrieves
       information protected by the passwords. Please make sure you remember
       the Master Password you have set. If yo forget your Master Password,
       you will be unable to access any of the information protected by it.

Maintain parallel constructions
-------------------------------

Create a clear distinction between the meaning of words and phrases.

       **Blocked**.

Ensure content is appropriate
-----------------------------

Consider a user’s likely goal, desire, or state of mind. Anticipate
confusion or frustration and respond appropriately. Prioritize utility over
personality.
