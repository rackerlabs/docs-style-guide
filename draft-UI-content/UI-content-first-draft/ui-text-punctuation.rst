UI text punctuation guidelines
==============================

Using punctuation consistently throughout a UI maintains a user-friendly and
professional look.

For more general information, see :ref:`punctuation`.


Apostrophes and quotation marks
-------------------------------

Use the typographic characters (also called smart quotes) for apostrophes and
quotation marks.

.. note::
   In some development work, this rule is enforced programmatically. Code
   might fails linter tests if a text string contains the straight
   apostrophe or quote.

Commas
------

Use serial commas (also called Oxford commas).

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

Hyphens and dashes
------------------

Use the following rules for hyphens and dashes:

- Use hyphens (-) to create a single idea out of two or more words.

  - Don’t add a space before or after the hyphen.

- Use en dashes (–) for ranges, like numbers (such as, 1–9) and
  dates.

  - Don’t add a space before of after the en dash.

- Use em dashes (—), the longest dashes, to set off a long qualifier in the
  middle of a sentence if the use of commas would hinder readability.

  - Don’t add a space before of after the en dash.
  - Don’t capitalize the word following an em dash, unless the word is proper.
  - Don’t use an em dash to separate a long sentence into two parts. Instead,
    create two sentences.

Ellipses
--------

Use ellipses with Button or Menu components when the action requires
additional user input, usually with a dialog, an alert, or a move
to another window or part of the UI.

Do not use an ellipsis in a link to indicate that more information is
available at the destination.

In general, do not use ellipses in body copy.

Exclamation points
------------------

Avoid using use exclamation points. If you must use them, use them sparingly -
when the text reflects genuine excitement, not as a way to create excitement.

Periods and other terminal punctuation
--------------------------------------

Don’t use end punctuation in the following content:

- Headings
- Subheadings
- UI titles
- Button labels
- Checkbox labels
- Radio button labels
- Tooltips
- Text links (unless the link ends a sentence)
- Navigation elements

End all sentences with a period, even if they're only two words. Put one
space, not two, after a period.
