UI text capitalization guidelines
=================================

For UI text, we use different capitalization styles for different types of
content to improve scannability, organize information, and guide users to key
actions.

When building new products, we also align capitalization practices with
platform conventions to match user expectations.

For more general information, see :ref:`capitalization`.

Capitalization styles
---------------------

UI elements use a combination of title-style capitalization
and sentence-style capitalization. It is important to apply these
capitalization guidelines consistently to make the UI clear and succinct.

Title-style capitalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For title-style capitalization, capitalize the first letter of nouns,
adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and pronouns in the text. You also capitalize the
first and last words of the text. However, use lowercase for the following
exceptions:

- Articles (*a*, *an*, *the*) unless they are the first or last
  words of the element.
- Coordinating conjunctions (*and*, *or*).
- Prepositions with fewer than five letters (*to*, *on*, *at*, *by*, *from*)
  unless they are the first or last words of the element.
- Infinitives (*to*, *in*, *an*)
- Capitalize the second word in a hyphenated compound if it would normally be
  capitalized as a single word. For example, you would capitalize both words
  in **Quick-Find Options**, but you would only capitalize *Add* in **Add-on
  Choices**.

The following table shows examples for title-style capitalization:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Don't use
   * - Restore Defaults
     - Restore defaults
   * - Allocate to Project
     - Allocate to project
   * - Show Add-on in Menu
     - Show Add-On in Menu

Sentence-style capitalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For sentence-style capitalization, most words are lowercase, with the following
exceptions.

- Capitalize only the first word of the text element.

- Capitalize any other words that you would normally capitalize, such as
  proper nouns.

The following table shows examples for sentence-style capitalization:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Don't use
   * - Maximum number of downloads
     - Maximum Number of Downloads
   * - Allocate to Project
     - Allocate to project

All caps capitalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In rare cases, all caps might be used to visually distinguish a secondary,
less important text element - for example, **GENERAL** as a menu heading.
